        <p>Hmong people are a people known to roam the hills of Southeast Asia. This is mainly due to the fact that Hmong people do not have their own country. Many Hmong people still reside in the hills of Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. There you may find the Hmong people with gardens, livestock, and small homes. Many live off the land, eating the vegetables they grow and the animals they raise. The Hmong culture is a Shaman based culture, meaning that we believe in many spiritual aspects.</p>
