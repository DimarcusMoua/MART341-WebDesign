        <h1>Hmong People?</h1>
        <p>The Hmong people are a small group of people. Our culture is a difficult and intricate one thus making it a difficult thing to learn. I believe our culture is a dying one. By that I mean that not enough young Hmong people have enough care for the culture. This is understandable to an extent of which our daily lives require a lot to keep up with the world but not only that, the American culture is seeming to take over the Hmong. As sad as this may be this is a true reality as I even see this within myself, but at any chance given, I want to understand the language and culture to keep my identity. Without the Hmong culture, I am not Chinese, Korean, Thai, or Vietnamese, I am just me. I want to understand my history, why we do things the way we do and much more.</p>
