        <h1 class="title">Hmong Missoula</h1>
        <p>Missoula has a special place in many Hmong hearts as this valley was called home for many. From the mid 70's through the 80's, many Hmong people were desperate to leave SouthEast Asia after the vietnam war. In partnership of the CIA, many Hmong refugees were relocated within the United States, Missoula being one of the first spots. The surrounding mountains, hills, and valley's were similar to the areas of which the Hmong people were used to. Therefore Missoula would be a perfect area for a new home. Since the arrival, many have found new homes in states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California as these states have high Hmong populations. Some still live in Missoula while others may have found homes in other states as well.  </p>
