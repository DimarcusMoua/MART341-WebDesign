        What would you call your <strong>favorite</strong> food? That question, especially to me, is a super tough question. For me, I need to think about all the foods I enjoy. Many foods I enjoy are foods that combine other cultures within it.

        In the modern world, many of these different kinds of cuisines cross paths with each other. For example, the popular Mexican Birria Tacos have been introduced to Ramen noodles and have gotten very popular since their introduction. These collaborations on food are only growing and continue to get better and better. Which would you say are your favorite kinds of collaboration?
