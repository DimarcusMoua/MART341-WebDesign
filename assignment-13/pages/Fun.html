    <div>
        <p>When the guys all get together,we often go bowling. We go so often that we know some of the workers at the bowling alley. If bowling sounds too exhausting, we then end up at Canyon's house where we watch movies, watch our own video game clips, or cook. In the summer, we tend to go get ice cream at the Big Dipper more than is reccommended but it is always a fun time. Lastly, we play video games just about every night we can with each other. We mainly play Rust console edition, Rocket League, Grand Theft Auto IV, Need for Speed Heat, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six siege.
