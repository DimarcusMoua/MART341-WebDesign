    <h1 class="head">The Guys</h1>
    <div>
        <p>"The Guys" can be used as a generic term to identify one's friends. For me, that is what I call them. Typically "The Guys" can be a smaller group, which mine only consists of about 4 if I were to include myself. Our original group hasn't necessarily fallen apart, rather busy with keeping up with what life has thrown at us after highschool.</p>

        <h2 class="head">Who am I missing?</h2>
        <p>Many of my friends that I view as life long friends are friends that I have grown up with since Kindergarten. Since then we have grown up together and matured together. This is, in my opinion, is what drives our friendships and connections so deep. Overall, our group had about seven of us. One, Dylan, has found himself with <a href="Cole.html">Cole</a> in Butte attending Montana Tech. There he as found another group of friends but still hangs out with the old gang when he heads home. Jon is another who has been keeping up with life as he has found a job that keeps him busy for <strong>12 HOURS</strong> and a girlfriend who also keeps him busy in the best way. Another was Johnny. Johnny has found himself also in a job at the bank and with a girlfriend as well. This keeps him busy most of the time and because of this he doesn't hang out with us as much anymore. Even though some of us have drifed away, we all soemtimes still connect on the Playstation. </p>
