        <h1>Why shoes?</h1>
        <p>My method of tying shoe laces took me forever to learn as I didn't know how to tie shoes until the 3rd grade. My first methods always confused me and, to me, came apart faster. This method saved me time and was super simple to me. I wanted to share how I do something simple and often overlooked as there are many different ways that shoes can be tied.</p>
