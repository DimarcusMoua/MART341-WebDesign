        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
           I put a sunglass on, so I don't have to say hi (hi)
            Send a text after I'm gone, I don't say goodbye (bye)
            And my Miss USA called for a ride (ride)
            She filled my tank, I didn't spend a dime (dime)<br/>  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="chorus" class="chorus">
        <p>
            And I don't mind at all
            And I don't cry
            Ask me how I feel, I'm dynamite
            And it goes like
            I'm not here for long, my baby
            I'm just passing by
            The world keeps getting hotter, baby
            But I'm too cool to die<br/>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="lyrics" class="lyrics">
        <p>
            She wanna fuck me on a jet
            But I'm scared to fly (fly)
            She wanna feed me fancy drinks
            And keep me up all night (night)
            She asked me if I like this wedding ring
            For fuck's sake, it's our first date
            I did, and then I went and bought it on the next date
            Fits me great, uh<br/>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="chorus" class="chorus">
        <p>
            And I don't mind at all
            And I don't cry (I don't cry, don't cry)
            Ask me how I feel, I'm dynamite
            And it goes like
            I'm not here for long, my baby
            I'm just passing by (passing by)
            The world keeps getting hotter, baby
            But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool, I'm too cool)<br?>
            I'm not here for long, my baby
            I'm just passing by (I'm just passing by)
            The world keeps getting hotter, baby
            But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool to die)
            I'm too cool to die
            I'm too cool to die, mm-mm
