    <h1 class="head">Playstation controllers vs Xbox controllers</h1>
    <p>Within the last few decades we have seen some awesome developments in gaming. For example we've seen the Playstation one evolve through the Playstation five along with Xbox evolving from the Xbox to the Xbox Series S. One could argue that these two amazing series of consoles have rivaled each other for years and still continue to. A key difference to me about the current consoles are the controllers. Over the years we have seen console after console come out but it seemed as if the controllers only changed a little bit. This can be seen less in Xbox nowadays as they have different controllers that have different buttons and analog sticks that can be attactched to one. Playstation, on the other hand, seemed to have similar controllers for years, at least to me. Recently, Playstation has had some new controllers come out such as the pro controller, which initially looks similar to a normal Playstation five controller. There is also a Razor controller that is designed for Playstation but Razor also produces a controller with the same features for Xbox as well starting at $200.</p>

    <h2 class="head">I wish</h2>
    <p>I wish that Playstation would spice up their controller game a tad. I mean simply even just colors of controllers would be an awesome addition to the collection of controllers people have already. On top of that, I really wish Playstation would have different things that could make the controllers better like Xbox. This would be huge as some players, including myself, envy how Xbox have produced very nice and comfortable controllers over the years. Though these thoughts might be easier said than done, there has got to be some way that Playstation can up their controllers.</p>
