    <p>This game was originally made by Psyonics and originally released in July of 2015. The game is pretty easy to understand. It's gameplay is just like soccer, get the ball into your opponent's net and win. Since its release there have been players that have risen above others and compete at high levels of the game. This level of gameplay and competitiveness created RLCS(Rocet League Championship Series) tournaments. These tournaments caught thousands of views, and in return, thousands of new players including myself.</p>

    <h2 id="mechanics" class="h2">What makes Rocket League so special?</h2>
    <p>Rocket League is a free game anyone can play but why play it? "Because it's fun" would be the easy answer but there is so much more to it than that. While the game itself is easy to understand, playing it is an entirely different story. To get the ball into your opponents net, you must "operate" a car of your choice. While doing this you must use tactics and <strong>mechanics</strong> to maneuver the ball into the opponents net. The <strong>Mechanics</strong> of the game is what really set the game apart from others as there are, what seems like, endless ways to use them. A few of the most common mechanics used in this game and in almost any trick are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Air Roll</li>
        <li>Air Roll Left</li>
        <li>Air Roll Right</li>
        <li>Boost</li>
        <li>Jump</li>
        <li>Double Jump</li>
        <li>Flip</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many of these mechanics are used together to do crazy things like the <a href="https://youtu.be/SeaHHL3D3nw?si=c3Iutw9tXNkiyGOa">Breezy Flick.</a> If you watched the video, one can see that there are different mechanics tied together to complete this trick. There are so many more tactics and skills that are used in the game and many more little details about the game. This is only a brief overview on the game.</p>
